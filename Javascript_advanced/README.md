<b>Needed info:

<b>Lexical scoping:<br> 
Refers to the scope(visability) of variables defined on a code block.<br> 
In Javascript if you define a variable inside a function It can only be accessed within that function,
not outside it.

<h4>Scope chain and closure:</h4>
<b>Closure:<br> 
a closure in Javascript is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them.

<br><b>Scope chain:<br>
This refers to the order in which the interpreter looks for variables. The innermost scope is checked first, then outer scopes, up to the global scope.

<b>Higher-order functions:<br>
Functions that return other functions.
