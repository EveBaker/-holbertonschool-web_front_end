## Needed info:

## Lexical scoping: 
Refers to the scope(visability) of variables defined om a code plock. 
In Javascript if you define a variable inside a function It can only be accessed within that function,
not outside it.

## Scope chain and closure:
## Closure: 
a closure in Javascript is a function that remembers its outer variables and can access them.

## Scope chain:
This refers to the order in which the interpreter looks for variables. The innermost scope is checked first, then outer scopes, up to the global scope.

## Higher-order functions:
Functions that return other functions.
